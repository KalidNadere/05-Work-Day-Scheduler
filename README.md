# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

By using Javascript and Jquery skills, I used arrays, if functions & loops, Day.js to create the work day scheduler.

The current day is to be displayed at the top of the calendar, upon scrolling down, the user is presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm. Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
When a time block is clicked into, the user is able to enter an event, click the save button for that time block and then the text for that event is saved in the local storage. Upon refreshing the page the saved events persist.
